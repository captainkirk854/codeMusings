Comment for Code Snippet:

	What the above code snippet does is to define a "Logical" resource. This is when elements and/or their styles
	are defined in this class' (Application) Resources property. These are typically meant to be shared by multiple 
	child elements. Resources fall into 2 broad categories: Styles and Data providers of which there are 2 type:
	Static or Dynamic 

	As this class happens to sit at the top of the WPF Applicaton Class hierarchy, the "ItalianFlagBackgroundForButtons"
	LinearGradientBrush style can be used by any inherited UI element.


	Note the name: <Application.Resources> (if in MainWindow.xaml, the required name would be: <Window.Resources>)
